## Configurability and Maintainability
1. Use a configuration file (e.g., config.json) for easily adjustable settings:
   - Bot token
   - Command prefix
   - Default volume
   - Maximum queue size
   - Allowed roles for certain commands
   - Cooldowns for commands
   - Custom status messages
2. Implement a modular command structure for easy addition/removal of commands
3. Use environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., bot token)
4. Implement error handling and logging for better debugging
5. Use comments and clear naming conventions for better code readability
6. Implement a plugin system for easy extension of functionality

## Code Quality
1. Follow JavaScript best practices and style guides (e.g., Airbnb style guide)
2. Use async/await for handling asynchronous operations
3. Implement proper error handling and input validation
4. Use ES6+ features for modern and clean code
5. Implement unit tests for core functionality
6. Use TypeScript for better type checking and code reliability

## Documentation
1. Provide a comprehensive README.md with:
   - Project description
   - Installation instructions
   - Configuration guide
   - Available commands and their usage
   - Troubleshooting section
2. Include inline code documentation for complex functions
3. Provide examples for configuring and extending the bot

## JMusicBot-inspired Features
1. Implement a permissions system similar to JMusicBot
2. Create an easy-to-use configuration file for bot settings
3. Implement playlist support with various sources (YouTube, Spotify, etc.)
4. Add support for multiple languages
5. Implement a web interface for easier management (optional)

These requirements aim to create a feature-rich, easily configurable, and well-maintained Discord music bot. The modular structure and comprehensive documentation will ensure that the bot is easy to set up, use, and extend.
